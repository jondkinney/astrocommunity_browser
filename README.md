# AstroCommunity Browser

A Neovim plugin designed to simplify navigation to AstroNvim community plugin repositories. This plugin parses a given line containing an AstroNvim community plugin import statement, constructs the corresponding GitHub URL, and opens it in the default web browser.

## Motivation

Navigating to the specific GitHub repository of an AstroNvim community plugin can be cumbersome. This plugin automates the process, allowing developers to quickly access the repository for documentation, issues, or contributions. By simply placing the cursor on the import line and running a command, the corresponding repository URL is opened in the default browser.

## Features

-  Parses lines containing AstroNvim community plugin import statements.
-  Constructs the corresponding GitHub URL.
-  Opens the URL in the default web browser.
-  Provides a user command and a built-in key mapping for ease of use.

## Installation

To install this plugin, use your preferred plugin manager. Hereâ€™s an example using `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
require('lazy').setup({
  {
    "jondkinney/astrocommunity_browser",
  },
})
```

And for AstroNvim

```lua
return {
  "jondkinney/astrocommunity_browser",
}
```
